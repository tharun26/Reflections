How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a place between working directory and repositroy. it is a place where we can keep and rethink and remove it .
once we confirm that these are the things needed to be into repo. we can commit. it is neat way to think in this manner.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

for a logical change gorup all the dependent files and put them in stage one by one.
then put a commit from staging to repo.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

branches will be very helpful in conditions where, i am working on a separate feature and i can work separeteley and merge with master
after some period..
