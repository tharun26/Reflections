    It made the task easier and i had to just see the changes made and compare only the lines changed.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
    I have the control and i must be the one taking the call whether to commit and give correct name for the
    commit.
    Cons:
    Sometime user might misjudge

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
